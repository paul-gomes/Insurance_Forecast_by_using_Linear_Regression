    "It seems like adding \"bmi\", \"regoion_num\" improves the model, and brings the score to 0.741449, which is better than the previous one. After my analysis, it is safe to say that \"isSmoker\", \"age\", \"bmi\", \"region\" affects the insurace cost very much. One of interesting findings here is that, if you smoke, your insurace costs tend to be higher. Moreover, smoking damages our body's natural defenses against the bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia, which is my next project, classifying pneumonia from chest X-Ray images.  "
